# Semester 1 Project

## Description

This is my first semester project as a front-end student; the project consists of building a community science museum web site. This site is build so that users can sign up by entering their information details
and purchasing a ticket in order to visit the museum for various amazing events and exploration. The age limit for visitation of this museum ranges with the age class group from young people to adults.
This project consisted of different pages which includes the following:
- Home page: this page gives an overview of the landing page presentation of this site
- Explore page: shows the different possible things to explore when visiting this museum and for the groups concerned with this exploration
- Exhibition page: presents the different craft and scientific works to be exhibited in the museum
- Events page: here i present the different events and up coming events the museum is hosting and will be hosting.
- About us: this page tells a bit about the museum historical facts and also a section on how to volunteer and support the museum
- visit/contact: this section gives an overview of the museum's location and how to contact the museum.
